# **Advice Generator Reactjs App**

I create ReactJS API data fetching project. **Advice Generator ReactJS App**.

The things that I learned and apply during completing this project is:

- Fetching data from APIs with `fetch` and `Axios` methods.
- Working with `Functional Component` in Reactjs.
- Learned and used `useEffect` Hook in the real world senerio.
- How to style React Components.
- How to convert the fetching data into the `json` object.
- Apply Html5 and CSS3.
